  "The main objective of this laboratory is to familiarize you with the training process of a neural network. More specifically, you'll follow this "<a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/">recipe</a>" for training neural networks proposed by Andrew Karpathy. You'll go through all the steps of training, data preparation, debugging, hyper-parameter tuning.

In the second part of the laboratory, you'll experiment with transfer learning and fine-tuning. Transfer learning is a concept from machine learning which allows you to reuse the knowledge gained while solving a problem (in our case the CNN weights) and applying it to solve a similar problem. This is useful when you are facing a classification problem with a small training dataset." <br>
